Project Overview
----------------
A Python/Pygame multi-game application featuring:
- Main menu interface
- Snake and Tetris games
- Game over screen
- Save/Load functionality

Progress Summary
----------------

1. Title & Logo Integration
   - Added `draw_title()` to render "PMD742OMNI GAME HUB" inside a semi-transparent white pill.
   - Integrated the game hub logo below the title text.
   - Implemented vertical centering using dynamic group height calculations.
   - Adjusted horizontal padding for proper text/icon fit.
   - Applied smoother pill edges via `border_radius = pill_height/2`.
   - Made pill size dynamic relative to the menu panel by passing `panel_rect` into `draw_title()`.

2. UI Pill Size Adjustments
   - Tuned side margins (`margin_x`) and vertical padding (`vpad`) for extra width and height.

3. `OrbitButton` Class Enhancements
   - Refactored from rotating icons to static rounded tablets.
   - Extended constructor to accept an optional `icon` argument.
